## Description

This project in the second in the Udacity Frond End Web Developer Program. It has HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 

## Objective

The purpose of this project was to build a multi-section landing page with dynamic navigation menu. 

## Functionality 

The sections can be added from the js file and navigation bar menu is dynamically built with each section that is being added. 

The section that is currently being viewed is distiguished by visual floating balls designs that are described in the CSS file. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item smoothly scrolls to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.

## Responsivness

All features are functional across all devices at different sizes. This is due to the usage of data structures and avoiding using "magic numbers". 
The responsive layout was verified by inspecting the landing page using the Developer Tools option on Google Chrome Browser.
